      Locking Down Tag-Based Releases from Environments

As a DevOps engineer, I’ve always found tag-based releases to be a powerful tool for managing deployments across multiple environments. They offer a level of precision and control that’s hard to match. But the challenge lies in ensuring that only the right branches - those that are production-ready - get deployed in a CI/CD pipeline.

      I learned about a nifty ForEach() powershell method when looping through an array. You can call it on a collection and pass a script block to it!

Context:
I was recently reading the new docs for GitHub copilot on how you can now use it in the CLI. GitHub launched the gh copilot explain and gh copilot suggest commands as part of the copilot extension in the GitHub CLI.

Example Problem:

      Relative paths are interpreted differently in .NET methods than in PowerShell.

Problem

While PowerShell automatically resolves relative paths based on the c...

      CCNA Commands

Here’s a PDF of the command book I created to pass the CCNA 200-301. I will one day convert this into an easy to read Markdown format, but for the time being, I’ve left it downloadable. Please contact me if you need a .docx version of this document so you can edit.
